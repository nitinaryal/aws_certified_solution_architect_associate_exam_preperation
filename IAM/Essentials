IAM Best Practices

1. Require human users to use federation with an identity provider to access AWS using temporary credentials
2. Require workloads to use temporary credentials with IAM roles to access AWS
3. Require multi-factor authentication (MFA)
4. Rotate access keys regularly for use cases that require long-term credentials
5. Safeguard your root user credentials and don't use them for everyday tasks
6. Apply least-privilege permissions
7. Get started with AWS managed policies and move toward least-privilege permissions
8. Use IAM Access Analyzer to generate least-privilege policies based on access activity
9. regularly review and remove unused users, roles, permissions, policies, and credentials
10. Use conditions in IAM policies to further restrict  access
11. Verify public and cross-account access to resources with IAM Access Analyzer
12. Use IAM Access Analyzer to validate your IAM policies to ensure secure and functinal permissions
13. Establish permissions guardrails across multiple accounts
14. Use permissions boundaries to delegate permissions management within an account
