Qn 1:
A company is deploying a new database on a new Amazon EC2 instance. The workload of this database requires a single Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume that can support up to 20,000 IOPS.

Which type of EBS volume meets this requirement?

1. A Throughput Optimized HDD 
2. A Provisioned IOPS SSD 
3. A General Purpose SSD
4. A Cold HDD

For more information about Cold HDD EBS volumes, see Amazon EBS Cold HDD Volumes.

Incorrect: A Throughput Optimized HDD EBS volume  is an HDD-backed storage device that is limited to 500 IOPS for each volume.

For more information about Throughput Optimized HDD EBS volumes, see Hard disk drives (HDD).

Correct: A Provisioned IOPS SSD EBS volume provides up to 64,000 IOPS for each volume.

For more information about Provisioned IOPS SSD EBS volumes, see Solid state drives (SSD).

Incorrect: A General Purpose SSD EBS volume is limited to 16,000 IOPS for each volume.

For more information about General Purpose SSD EBS volumes, see Solid state drives (SSD).

Incorrect: A Cold HDD volume provides low-cost magnetic storage that defines performance in terms of throughput rather than IOPS. Cold HDD volumes are a good fit for large, sequential cold-data workloads.
